# GZHousing (CreativeHousing)

This plugin is the definition of **dogshit**. I don't recommend using it on production, as it's poorly made by a bad Dev, and probably has a lot of bugs and security flaws.
I will **maybe** try to optimize this code a little, but it's still not a good choice to use it on production.
This code won't probably even work unless you focus on fixing it.

If you want to change something, you can create a pull request.

The code is not tested or anything, it's just mashed up into a repository.
node part is decompiled as the code was lost.

This plugin belongs to the Gold-Zone.cz Network, and is shared with the approval of the Founder.

## How to (probably) use
I have no fucking idea. Run these plugins, create your database tables, run the node runnable on your machine, and watch your machine's ram get eaten I guess?
